1. Run (r N)
Run the simulator for N cycles and display the waveforms at the current monitor points. Assume
a cold start-up of the circuit, so randomise the state of DTYPE latches and clocks before the first
simulation cycle. Clear any existing signal traces.

2. Continue (c N)
Continue running the simulator (e.g. after changing a switch) for N cycles and display the waveforms
at the current monitor points.

3. Set switch (s X N)
Set switch X to N (0 or 1).

4. Set monitor point (m X)
Add the output signal X to the current list of monitor points.

5. Zap monitor point (z X)
Remove the monitor point X.

6. Help (h)
Print a list of available commands on the terminal.

7. Quit (q)
Quit the simulation
